DangerZone is a system to help make workplaces safer. It works by allowing both people and sensor to be grouped into physical zones. If a sensor on a persion or as part of a device detects somethings such as flame, it will send and alert to either just the person, everyone in the zone, or all members enrolled in the system. As employees move, the zone they are in will also change. This helps identify the area and nature of an emergency so it can be dealth with swiftly.
